For studies I focus on topics in computer vision, deep learning, and natural language processing.
I have been working the Developmental Cognition and Neuroimaging (DCAN) labs since Fall of 2016.
My role is primarily the development and refinement of image processing techniques, 
as well as design of streamlined data pipelines for the batch processing of tens of thousands of MRI scans as a part of Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study.
I also work to bridge the gaps in MRI processing techniques, adapting our methods to work in elderly and newborn populations, as well as in primate research.
I have formed many lifelong relationships during my time with this lab, spending time in and out of work together.
I enjoy the work that we do and have enjoyed watching the lab grow as a result of our combined efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my free time I enjoy world travel.
I spent most of 2015-2016 motorcycling through Central America, and have so far ridden through every country in North America.
I hiked volcanoes, camped in the desert, found hidden hot springs, ferried my way to little tropical islands, and cruised through scenic rainforest highways.
More recently I've set my sights on some European destinations, starting with a trip to Italy in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also a lover of camping, music festivals, snowboarding, and beaches.
I like to stay fit, practicing handstands and various gymnastic movements, so I can take my fitness with me wherever I go.
When I'm less active I enjoy books, movies, comics, strategy games, and a good Czech beer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="about"></category></entry></feed>
